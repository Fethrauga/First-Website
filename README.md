Hello! This is my first true repository. I decided that I would put to good use the web dev skills I have learned thus far to attempt and create a good looking website. I decided it would be fun to create an older style website while at the same time combining some other more modern things. I couldn't think of the best topic, so I decided to go through and give a very quick and not so thorough run down of HTML and CSS, the only two languages I know thus far. Hopefully, as I progress, this website will become better and better.
