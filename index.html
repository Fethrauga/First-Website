          Before we get into CSS, we need to dive into what HTML is. HTML is the backbone for any website or application that exists. You cannot have a website without HTML. This is because of what it does. HTML is used to create text inside sometimes invisible boxes, create forms, add buttons and different types of inputs, and using something called <em>inline styling</em>, you can even add different colors, fonts, and shapes. This is what allows us to create beautiful websites; After all, what would a website be if it didn't have text or shapes and color? The only way to create those colors and shapes is if you have something to style, which HTML kindly provides.

           <span title="HTML Format Example"><img src="https://codebrainer.azureedge.net/images/basic-html-format.jpg" alt="A Picture of HTML Format"></span> So what exactly <em><u>can</u></em> we do with HTML? Well, to answer that question, we need to first dive into what HTML format looks like. I think that this image sums up the format pretty well. First off, lets go over the basics. There are a couple of things that go into the structure of HTML, the first one of which is <strong>tags</strong>. Tags are what you see between the &lt &gt signs. Most tags have an opening and a closing tag. The opening tags consist of just <u>&lt &gt</u>. The closing tags consist of <u>&lt /&gt</u>. Then you have <strong>attributes</strong>. These add extra properties to the tags allowing them to do different things. One of the attributes I used in this website is with the section title that says HTML. If you hover over it, you will find that a little pop up appears underneath your cursor. This is because of the title attribute, which allows you to display anything text you want to explain a word or picture. This is used commonly by websites like Wikipedia. If you hover over one of their links on a page, out will pop a description and usually a picture right underneath your cursor. If you will notice however, my title is on a word, and not a link like in Wikipedia. This is because the title attribute can be applied to pretty much anything, even a picture (Hmm... I wonder if the picture says anything?).

            CSS is, as I mentioned earlier, used to style websites by applying different colors and shapes and styles to text, background, and many more through something called <strong>selectors</strong>. But before we get into that, lets quickly dive into what CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, means. The name is descriptive of what it does: in a given CSS file, the browser looks at the top of the file, and as it goes down through it applies all the styles it reads. Because it reads the file and applies styles in this manner, generally speaking, the last style that was applied to an element is the one to actually be applied, meaning all previous styles applied to that element will no longer be in effect. This can be used to our advantage, because we can apply a general style to a webpage and all that is in it, but tweak specific elements in that webpage to look how we want. Cool, right?

          Moving on to selectors. Selectors are basically just the tag name, but without all the less than and greater than signs around it. If I were to have an h1 element, then to target it with a selector in CSS, all I would have to do is type "h1 {}", and anything I put into the curly brackets is then applied to all h1 elements. Congratulations, you now know how to format all of CSS. It's really just the selector, and a pair of curly brackets. That is all I am going to dive into in terms of code today.
